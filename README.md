# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

If given more time, the following enhancements could significantly improve the user experience and technical robustness of the application:

- **Add Unit Tests**: Implement unit testing using **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure component reliability and minimize bugs.
- **Improve UI/UX**: Enhance the design with **CSS transitions**, **hover effects**, and **smoother animations**.
- **Hourly Forecast**: Include an hourly weather forecast for better granularity.
- **Weather Icons**: Integrate condition-based icons for a more visual experience.
- **Dark & Light Theme Toggle**: Provide users with the ability to switch between light and dark modes.
- **Search Auto-Suggestions**: Add location autocomplete using services like Mapbox or OpenCage Geocoder.
- **More Attractive Styling**: Enhance responsiveness, layout , and modern visual styling.
- **Component-level Test Cases**: Expand test coverage input variations, and mocked API responses.
